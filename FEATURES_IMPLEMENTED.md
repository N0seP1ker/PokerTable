# ✅ Features Implemented

## 🔐 User Persistence & Authentication

### LocalStorage Persistence
- ✅ **Username saved automatically** - Once you enter your name, it's saved to localStorage
- ✅ **Auto-login on return** - If you close the tab and reopen, your name is remembered
- ✅ **Seamless rejoining** - Opening a room link auto-joins you if you have a saved name
- ✅ **Cross-session persistence** - Your name survives browser restarts

### How it works:
```javascript
// Saves on first entry
localStorage.setItem('pokerPlayerName', yourName)

// Auto-loads on return
const savedName = localStorage.getItem('pokerPlayerName')

// Auto-joins if room URL + saved name exists
if (roomURL && savedName) {
  autoJoin(room)
}
```

## 👑 Owner/Player Privilege System

### Backend Implementation
- ✅ **Owner privilege** - Automatically assigned to room creator
- ✅ **Player privilege** - Assigned to everyone who joins
- ✅ **Type-safe system** - TypeScript `PlayerPrivilege` type: `'owner' | 'player'`
- ✅ **Backend validation** - Server checks privileges before actions

### Updated Type System:
```typescript
export type PlayerPrivilege = 'owner' | 'player';

export interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  privilege: PlayerPrivilege;  // ← NEW!
  isHost: boolean;  // Kept for backwards compatibility
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Server Logging:
```
Room created: abc-123 by Alice (owner)
Player Bob joined room abc-123 (player)
```

## 🔗 Automatic Room Creation

### Smart URL Handling
- ✅ **No room in URL?** → Creates new room automatically
- ✅ **Room in URL?** → Joins that room
- ✅ **Saved name + room URL?** → Auto-joins immediately

### Flow:
```
User enters name → Click "Create Room"
                ↓
          Create room with name: "{Name}'s Room"
                ↓
          Navigate to: /room/{room-id}
                ↓
          URL becomes shareable link
```

### Example:
- You enter "Alice"
- Room created: "Alice's Room"
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/room/abc-def-123`

---

## 🔗 Room URL System

### Shareable Links
- ✅ **Copy button** - One-click copy to clipboard
- ✅ **Clean URLs** - Easy to share via text/email
- ✅ **Deep linking** - Links go directly to room
- ✅ **Query param support** - `/?room={id}` for landing page

### URL Format:
```
Main app:     http://localhost:3000
Landing:      http://localhost:3000/
Room (direct):http://localhost:3000/room/abc-123
Room (param): http://localhost:3000/?room=abc-123
```

### Sharing Flow:
1. Player A creates room
2. Gets URL: `http://localhost:3000/?room=abc-123`
3. Copies and sends to Player B
4. Player B opens link
5. Enters name (or uses saved name)
6. Auto-joins room
